\title{Mutual information of two splits}
\usage{
SplitMutualInformation(n, A1, A2 = A1)

SplitVariationOfInformation(n, A1, A2 = A1)

TreesConsistentWithTwoSplits(n, A1, A2 = A1)

LnTreesConsistentWithTwoSplits(n, A1, A2 = A1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer specifying the number of terminals.}

\item{A1, A2}{Integers specifying the number of taxa in \emph{A1} and \emph{A2},
once the splits have been arranged such that \emph{A1} fully overlaps with \emph{A2}.}
}
\value{
\code{TreesConsistentWithTwoSplits} returns the number of unrooted bifurcating
trees consistent with two splits.

\code{SplitMutualInformation} returns the information that two splits
have in common, in bits.

\code{SplitVariationOfInformation} returns the variation of information (Meila 2007)
between the two splits, a measure of their difference, in bits.
}
\description{
Reports the mutual phylogenetic information, or variation of phylogenetic
information, of two splits.
}
\details{
The mutual phylogenetic information corresponds to the entropy of the subset
of trees consistent with both splits; two splits that are consistent with a
smaller number of trees will have a higher mutual information content.

Split 1 divides \code{n} terminals into two partitions, \emph{A1} and \emph{B1}.
Split 2 divides the same terminals into the partitions \emph{A2} and \emph{B2}.

Partitions must be named such that \emph{A1} fully overlaps with \emph{A2}:
that is to say, all taxa in \emph{A1} are also in \emph{A2}, or \emph{vice versa}.
Thus, all taxa in the smaller of \emph{A1} and \emph{A2} also occur in the larger.

  # Eight tips, labelled A to H.
  # Split 1: ABCD:EFGH
  # Split 2: ABC:DEFGH
  # Let A1 = ABCD (four taxa), and A2 = ABC (three taxa).
