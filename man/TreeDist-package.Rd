\title{TreeDist:  Distances between Phylogenetic Trees}
\description{
\code{TreeDist} implements a suite of metrics that quantify the topological
distance between pairs of unweighted phylogenetic trees.
The metrics generally fall in the category of "generalized Robinson-Foulds
distances": they are based on comparing partitions between trees, and thus
reflect the relationship data within trees, with no reference to branch
lengths.
Detailed documentationand usage instructions are
\href{https://ms609.github.org/TreeDist}{available online} or in the vignettes.
}
\details{
The \href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/articles/Robinson-Foulds.html}{Robinson-Foulds distance}
simply tallies the number of splits (loosely, clades) that occur in both trees --
any splits that are not perfectly identical are assigned a score of zero, however similar
or different they are.
By overlooking potential similarities between almost-identical splits,
this conservative approach has undesirable properties.

\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/articles/Generalized-RF.html}{'Generalized' RF metrics}
pair each split in one tree with a similar split in the other.
Each pair of splits is assigned a similarity
score; the sum of these scores in the optimal partition matching
then describes the similarity between two trees.

Different ways of calculating the the similarity between a pair of partitions
lead to different tree distance metrics, implemented in the functions below:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/TreeDistance.html}{MutualClusteringInfo}, \href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/TreeDistance.html}{SharedPhylogeneticInfo}
}
\itemize{
\item Smith (forthcoming) scores matchings based on the amount of information
that one partition contains about the other.  The Mutual Phylogenetic
Information imposes arboreal matching: i.e. a pair of splits that cannot
both exist on a single tree are assigned zero similarity.  The Mutual
Clustering Information metric is more forgiving, and exhibits more
desirable behaviour; it is the recommended metric for tree comparison.
(The corresponding
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/TreeDistance.html}{ClusteringInfoDistance}
returns a tree distance.)
}
\itemize{
\item \href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/NyeTreeSimilarity.html}{NyeTreeSimilarity}
}
\itemize{
\item Nye \emph{et al.} (2006) score matchings according to the size of the largest
split that is consistent with both of them, normalized against
the Jaccard index.  This approach is extended by BÃ¶cker \emph{et al}. (2013)
with the Jaccard-Robinson-Foulds metric (function
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/JaccardRobinsonFoulds.html}{JaccardRobinsonFoulds}).
}
\itemize{
\item \href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/MatchingSplitDistance.html}{MatchingSplitDistance}
}
\itemize{
\item Bogdanowicz and Giaro (2012), and independently Lin \emph{et al.} (2012), count
the number of 'mismatched' leaves in a pair of splits. An
information-based equivalent (Smith, forthcoming) is provided in the function
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/TreeDistance.html}{MatchingSplitInfoDistance}.
}

The package also implements the variation of the path distance
proposed by Kendal and Colijn (2016) (function
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/KendallColijn.html}{KendallColijn}),
approximations of the Nearest-Neighbour Interchange (NNI) distance (function
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/NNIDist.html}{NNIDist}; following
Li \emph{et al.} (1996)), and calculates the size (function
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/MASTSize.html}{MASTSize}) and
information content (function
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/reference/MASTSize.html}{MASTInfo}) of the
Maximum Agreement Subtree.
