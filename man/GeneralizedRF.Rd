\usage{
GeneralizedRF(splits1, splits2, nTip, PairScorer, maximize, reportMatching,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{splits1}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a leaf,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a split, such that each leaf is identified as
a member of the ingroup (\code{TRUE}) or outgroup (\code{FALSE}) of the respective
split.}

\item{splits2}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a leaf,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a split, such that each leaf is identified as
a member of the ingroup (\code{TRUE}) or outgroup (\code{FALSE}) of the respective
split.}

\item{nTip}{Integer specifying the number of leaves in each split.}

\item{PairScorer}{function taking four arguments, \code{splits1}, \code{splits2},
\code{nSplits1}, \code{nSplits2}, which should return the score of each pair of splits
in a two-dimensional matrix.  Additional parameters may be specified via
\dots.}

\item{reportMatching}{Logical specifying whether to return the clade
matchings as an attribute of the score.}

\item{\dots}{Additional parameters to \code{PairScorer}}
}
\value{
A numeric value specifying the score of the tree pairs under the
specified pair scorer. If \code{reportMatching = TRUE}, attribute also list:
\itemize{
\item \code{matching}: which split in \code{splits2} is optimally matched to each split in
\code{split1} (\code{NA} if not matched);
\item \code{pairScores}: Calculated scores for each possible matching of each split.
\item \code{matchedSplits}: Textual representation of each match
}
}
\description{
An internal function to calculate Generalized Robinson-Foulds distance from
splits.
}
\details{
Note that no checks will be made to confirm that splits1 and splits2 contain
the same leaves in the same order.  This is the responsibility of the calling
function.
