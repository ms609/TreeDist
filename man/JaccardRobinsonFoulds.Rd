\arguments{
\item{tree1}{Trees of class \code{phylo}, with leaves labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{tree2}{Trees of class \code{phylo}, with leaves labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{k}{An arbitrary exponent to which to raise the Jaccard index.
Integer values greater than one are anticipated by Böcker \emph{et al}.
The Nye \emph{et al}. metric uses \code{k = 1}.
As k → ∞, the metric converges to the Robinson-Foulds metric.}

\item{arboreal}{Logical specifying whether to enforce arboreal matches, by
assigning zero similarity to contradictory pairs of splits on an
\emph{ad hoc} basis.}

\item{similarity}{Logical specifying whether to report the result as a tree
similarity, rather than a difference.}

\item{normalize}{If a numeric value is provided, this will be used as a
maximum value against which to rescale results.
If \code{TRUE}, results will be rescaled against a maximum value calculated from
the specified tree sizes and topology, as specified in the 'Normalization'
section below.
If \code{FALSE}, results will not be rescaled.}

\item{reportMatching}{Logical specifying whether to return the clade
matchings as an attribute of the score.}

\item{splits1}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a leaf,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a split, such that each leaf is identified as
a member of the ingroup (\code{TRUE}) or outgroup (\code{FALSE}) of the respective
split.}

\item{splits2}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a leaf,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a split, such that each leaf is identified as
a member of the ingroup (\code{TRUE}) or outgroup (\code{FALSE}) of the respective
split.}

\item{nTip}{Integer specifying the number of leaves in each split.}
}
\value{
An array of numerics providing the distances between each pair of
trees in \code{tree1} and \code{tree2}, or \code{splits1} and \code{splits2}.

\details{
In short, the Jaccard-Robinson-Foulds metric is a generalized Robinson-Foulds
metric: it finds the optimal matching that pairs each split in one tree with
a similar split in the second.
Matchings are scored according to the size of the largest split that is
consistent with both of them, normalized against the Jaccard index, and
raised to an arbitrary exponent.
A more detailed explanation is provided in the
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/articles/Generalized-RF.html#jaccard-robinson-foulds-metric}{vignettes}.

By default, arboreal matchings are enforced.

Note that the settings \verb{k = 1, arboreal = FALSE, similarity = TRUE}
give the similarity metric of Nye \emph{et al}. (2006); a slightly faster
implementation of this metric is available as \code{\link{NyeTreeSimilarity}}.

The examples section below details how to visualize matchings with
non-default parameter values.

\section{Normalization}{


If \code{normalize = TRUE}, then results will be rescaled from zero to one by
dividing by the maximum possible value for trees of the given topologies,
which is equal to the sum of the number of splits in each tree.
You may wish to normalize instead against the maximum number of splits
present in a pair of trees with \emph{n} leaves, by specifying
\code{normalize = n - 3}.
