## Downstream dependencies

["revdepcheck"](https://github.com/ms609/TreeDist/actions/workflows/revdepcheck.yml)
confirmed no changes to worse in the three downstream dependencies:

  'Rogue', 'TBRDist', and 'TreeSearch'
  
(all of which I maintain).
  

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE:

> Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories:
>   TreeDistData
> Availability using Additional_repositories specification:
>   TreeDistData   yes   https://ms609.github.io/packages/TreeDistData
[...]
> Package suggested but not available for checking: 'TreeDistData'

'TreeDistData' is too large to be submitted on CRAN.

All calls to `data(package = "TreeDistData")` are wrapped within 
`if(require('TreeDistData'))` to ensure that vignettes fail gracefully when
'TreeDistData' is not installed.
