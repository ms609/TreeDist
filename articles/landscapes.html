<p>Landscapes of trees are <a href="treespace.html">mappings of tree space</a> that are contoured according to some optimality criterion – often, but not necessarily, a tree’s score under a phylogenetic reconstruction technique <span class="citation">(Bastert, Rockmore, Stadler, &amp; Tinhofer, 2002)</span>. Detecting “islands” or “terraces” of trees can illuminate the nature of the space of optimal trees and thus inform tree search strategy <span class="citation">(Maddison, 1991; Sanderson, McMahon, &amp; Steel, 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>For simplicity (and to avoid scoring trees against a dataset), this example uses a tree’s balance (measured using the total cophenetic index) as its score <span class="citation">(Mir, Rosselló, &amp; Rotger, 2013)</span>. We assume that mappings have already been shown to be <a href="treespace.html">adequate</a> <span class="citation">(Smith, 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>A landscape is most simply visualized by colouring each tree according to its score:</p>

<p>A more sophisticated output can be produced using contours, interpolating between adjacent trees. This example uses a simple inverse distance weighting function for interpolation; more sophisticated techniques such as <a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/3d-analyst-toolbox/how-kriging-works.htm" class="external-link">kriging</a> or (in continuous tree spaces) the use of geodesics <span class="citation">(Khodaei, Owen, &amp; Beerli, 2022)</span> can produce even better results.</p>
