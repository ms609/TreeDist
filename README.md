`TreeDist` implements a suite of metrics that quantify the topological 
distance between pairs of unweighted phylogenetic trees.
The metrics generally fall in the category of "generalized Robinson-Foulds
distances": they are based on comparing partitions between trees, and thus
reflect the relationship data within trees, with no reference to branch lengths.

The Robinson-Foulds distance simply tallies the number of bipartition splits
(loosely, clades) that occur in both trees -- any clades that are not perfectly 
identical are assigned a score of zero, however similar or different they are.
By overlooking potential similarities between almost-identical bipartitions, 
this conservative approach has undesirable properties.

'Generalized' RF metrics pair each bipartition in one tree with a similar
bipartition in the other.  Each pair of partitions is assigned a similarity 
score; the sum of these scores in the optimal partition matching 
then describes the similarity between two trees. 

Different ways of calculating the the similarity between a pair of partitions 
lead to different tree distance metrics, implemented in the functions below:


* `MutualClusteringInfo`, `MutualPhylogeneticInfo`
    Smith (forthcoming) scores matchings based on the amount of information
    that one partition contains about the other.  The Mutual Phylogenetic
    Information imposes arboreal matching: i.e. a pair of splits that cannot
    both exist on a single tree are assigned zero similarity.  The Mutual 
    Clustering Information metric is more forgiving, and exhibits more 
    desirable behaviour; it is the recommended metric for tree comparison.
    (Its complement, `VariationOfClusteringInfo`, returns a tree 
    distance.)

* `NyeTreeSimilarity`
    Nye _et al._ (2006) score matchings according to the size of the largest 
    bipartition that is consistent with both of them, normalized against 
    the Jaccard index.
   
* `MatchingSplitDistance` 
    Bogdanowicz and Giaro (2012), and independently Lin _et al._ (2012), count 
    the number of 'mismatched' terminals in a pair of bipartitions.

The package also implements the variation of the path distance 
proposed by Kendal and Colijn (2016) (function `KendallColijn`).
