#' Approximate the NNI distance
#' 
#' An approximation of the Nearest Neighbour Interchange distance, based on
#' Li et al. (1996).
#' 
#' In brief, this approximation algorithm works by identifying edges in one
#' tree that do not match edges in the second.  Each of these edges must
#' undergo at least one NNI operation in order to reconcile the trees.
#' Edges that match in both trees need never undergo an NNI operation, and 
#' divide each tree into smaller regions.  By 'cutting' matched edges into two,
#' a tree can be divided into a number of regions that solely comprise unmatched
#' edges.
#' 
#' These regions can be viewed as separate trees that need to be reconciled.
#' One way to reconcile these trees is to conduct a series of NNI operations
#' that reduce a tree to a pectinate (caterpillar) tree, then to conduct an 
#' analogue of the mergesort algorithm.  This takes at most _n_ log _n_ + O(_n_)
#' NNI operations, and provides a loose upper bound on the NNI score. 
#' The maximum number of moves for a tree with _n_ tips can be calculated 
#' exactly for small trees; this provides a tighter upper bound, but is 
#' unavailable for _n_ > 12.

#' @return `NNIDist` returns, for each pair of trees, a named vector
#'  containing three integers:
#' 
#' - `lower` is a lower bound on the NNI distance, and corresponds
#' to the RF distance between the trees. 
#' 
#' - `tight_upper` is an upper bound on the distance, based on calculated
#' maximum diameters for trees with <12 tips.  _NA_ is returned if trees are
#' too different to employ this approach.
#' 
#' - `loose_upper` is a looser upper bound on the distance, using _n_ log _n_ +
#' O(_n_).
