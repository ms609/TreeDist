Some of the shortcomings of the [Robinson-Foulds distance](Robinson-Foulds.html)
are addressed by Generalized Robsinson-Foulds distances, a set of metrics which
aim to acknowledge semblances between similar-but-not-quite-identical
pairs of partitions.

Generalized RF distances work by pairing each partition in one tree with a 
similar partition in the other (or leaving it unpaired).  Each pairing is
scored according to the similarity of the paired partitions.  The decision
of which partition to pair with which is called a _matching_, and a matching
is scored by summing the individual similarity scores of each pair.
The tree distance is given by the score of the optimal matching.

# Constructing a matching

Let's consider two trees that differ in the position of a wildcard terminal,
and in the resolution of a clade:

```{r plot-function, echo=FALSE}
library('TreeDist')
Plot <- function (tree, tree2=NULL, highlight = character(0),
                  prune=if (is.null(tree2)) integer(0) else list(integer(0), integer(0))) {
  ABCDEFGHIJK <- LETTERS[1:11]
  if (is.null(tree2)) {
    if(!all(tree$tip.label %in% 1:11)) {
      tree$tip.label <- match(tree$tip.label, ABCDEFGHIJK)
    }
    
    highlightTip <- match(highlight, ABCDEFGHIJK)
    TreeDistPlot(tree, leaveRoom=FALSE, 
                 bold = highlightTip,
                 prune = prune,
                 graft = which(tree$edge[, 2] == match(highlightTip, tree$tip.label)))
  } else {
    par(mfrow=c(1, 2), mar=rep(0.4, 4))
    Plot(tree, highlight = highlight, prune = prune[[1]])
    Plot(tree2, highlight = highlight, prune = prune[[2]])
  }
}
```

```{r}
tree1 <- ape::read.tree(text='((A, B), (((C, (D, E)), (F, (G, (H, I))))));')
tree2 <- ape::read.tree(text='((A, B), (((C, D, (E, I)), (F, (G, H)))));')
Plot(tree1, tree2, highlight = 'I', prune=list(8, integer(0)))
```

The Robinson-Foulds distance will see only one partition in common between the two
trees, AB:CDEFGHI:

```{r}
VisualizeMatching(RobinsonFoulds, tree1, tree2)
```

This results in a distance score of nine, out of a maximum possible (for
trees exhibiting this resolutioN) of eleven;
the Robinson-Foulds distance is the number of partitions present in one tree 
but not the other.
