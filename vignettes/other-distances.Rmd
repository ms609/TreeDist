This vignette provides a very brief summary of other tree distances.
Do please 
[let me know](https://github.com/ms609/TreeDist/issues/new?title=Other%20tree%20distances)
of any omissions.

# Other topological distances

- nni, spr, tbr
  - NNI navigation dissimilarity [@Arslan2017] is an O(_n_Â²) approximation of
    the NNI distance.  Related distances in this family emphasize links to
    cluster compatibility.

- path 
  - can incorporate edge length information
  - to emphasize position of root: [@Kendall2016]

- The **transposition distance** [@Valiente2005;@Alberich2009] is the number of
  leaf-moves that must be conducted to make the splits in one tree match
  the splits in a second.  It can be calculated in linear time (i.e. quickly),
  and its properties (e.g. diameter, the largest possible distance) are readily
  calculated.  It takes a small range of integer values, so like the RF distance
  lacks resolution and specificity. The maximum distance is obtained in a pair
  of pectinate trees in which a single leaf is transposed from one side to the
  other; like the RF distance, therefore, trees that agree on most relationship
  information can obtain a higher distance than those that do not.
  It is sensitive to the order in which the leaves are numbered, i.e. the 
  internal representation of the tree; and to the position of the root.
  
  

# Other tree distances

Other categories of tree distance are not (yet) discussed here; these are useful
in contexts where branch length information is important, or where tree
topology (and the associated relationship information) is of secondary
importance.

- Leaf-to-leaf distances [e.g. @Leigh2011] ignore topology
- Geodesic distances define a space based on branch lengths +
topology.  The canonical 'BHV' space [@Billera2001] has been extended 
in a number of ways.

- KF distance: RF, weighted by edge length



- Tropical tree space [@Speyer2004;@Lin2020]

- Probabilistic / Information geometry [@Garba2018;@Garba2020]

- Distances between unlabelled trees (tree shapes)
  * Polynomial distance: [@Liu2021;@Liu2020]
