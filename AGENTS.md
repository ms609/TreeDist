# TreeDist — Agent Memory

## Project Overview

**TreeDist** is an R package (GPL ≥ 3) providing a suite of topological distance metrics
between phylogenetic trees. The mathematical core is implemented in C++17 and exposed to R
via Rcpp. The primary optimization goal is speed: many real analyses compute pairwise
distances over hundreds or thousands of trees, so inner loops must be tight.

Current version: `2.12.0.9000` (development).

## Key Optimizations Already in Place

Understanding what has already been done avoids duplicating effort.

### Memory / cache
- **64-byte alignment** (`alignas(64)`) on `CostMatrix::data_` and `t_data_`.
- `CostMatrix` pads row width to a multiple of `BLOCK_SIZE = 16` so SIMD loads never
  straddle cache lines.
- A **transposed copy** of the cost matrix is maintained to allow column-wise access with
  sequential memory reads.

### Arithmetic
- **Lookup tables** in `information.h` for `log2` (values 0–(SL_MAX_TIPS-1)²) and
  `log2_factorial` (up to 8192); initialized via `__attribute__((constructor))`.
  Using these avoids runtime `std::log2()` calls on hot paths.
- **Loop unrolling** — `CostMatrix::findRowSubmin()` manually unrolls 4× (comment:
  "gives ~20% speedup").
- **`__restrict__`** pointer annotations in `lap.cpp` and `tree_distances.h` to enable
  compiler alias analysis.
- **`__builtin_assume_aligned(ptr, 64)`** hints around inner loops.
- **`__builtin_popcount()`** for split-bit counting.

### Algorithm
- **Column reduction in reverse order** in LAPJV (faster convergence).
- **`findRowSubmin` two-pass strategy** avoids redundant comparisons.
- **LAPJV v2.10.0** achieved a 2× speedup for large matrices via reorganisation.
- **`HybridBuffer<T, StackSize>`** in `nni_distance.cpp`: small allocations go on the
  stack (thresholds: 512 splits, 16 bins) to avoid heap overhead.
- **Tree reduction** (`reduce_tree.cpp`): trees are pruned to their common tip set before
  any distance is computed; this is a major algorithmic win for partially-overlapping
  taxon sets.

### Types
- `cost = int_fast64_t` for LAP to avoid overflow and exploit 64-bit registers.
- `BIG = numeric_limits<cost>::max() / SL_MAX_SPLITS` — the divide avoids integer
  overflow inside the LAP inner loop.
- `ROUND_PRECISION = 2048²` for safe rounding in cost scaling.

## Benchmark Infrastructure

All benchmarks live in `benchmark/` and use the `bench` package.

```r
source("benchmark/_init.R")   # loads TreeTools, TreeDist; defines Benchmark()
```

`Benchmark(expr)` wraps `bench::mark()` with `min_iterations = 3` and `time_unit = "us"`.
When run non-interactively (e.g. CI) results are serialised to `.bench.Rds` files.
`_compare_results.R` compares PR results against `main` and fails the build on a
regression > 4 %.

### Existing benchmark scripts

| Script | What it tests |
|--------|---------------|
| `bench-tree-distances.R` | CID, PID, RF, MCI on 100×50-tip and 40×200-tip tree sets |
| `bench-LAPJV.R` | LAPJV on 40×40, 400×400, 1999×1999 uniform random matrices |
| `bench-PathDist.R` | PathDist on 6×182-tip trees |
| `bench-MCI-openmp.R` | MCI/CID OpenMP scaling on 100×50, 40×200, and 200×200-tip tree sets |

To add a new benchmark, create `benchmark/bench-<topic>.R` following the existing pattern
and add it to `_run_benchmarks.R`.

## Profiling with VTune

VTune 2025.9 is installed at:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\vtune\2025.9\bin64\vtune.exe
```

Typical workflow:
1. Build TreeDist with debug symbols but optimisations enabled:
   `PKG_CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g"` in `~/.R/Makevars`.
2. Write a driver `.R` script that exercises the hot path in a loop (use the benchmark
   scripts as a starting point).
3. Run a hotspot collection:
   ```
   vtune -collect hotspots -result-dir vtune-out -- Rscript path/to/driver.R
   ```
4. View the report:
   ```
   vtune -report hotspots -result-dir vtune-out
   ```
   Or open the `.vtune` project in the VTune GUI.
5. Pay attention to the **Memory Access** and **Threading** analyses for cache-miss and
   false-sharing diagnostics.

## TreeTools Dependency

`../TreeTools` is available locally and editable. It is linked at the C++ level via
`LinkingTo`; the key header consumed by TreeDist is `<TreeTools/SplitList.h>`.

Important constants defined there that affect TreeDist:
- `SL_MAX_TIPS` — maximum number of leaf taxa per tree.
- `SL_MAX_SPLITS` — maximum number of splits.
- `splitbit` — the unsigned integer type used for bitset representation of splits.

If a bottleneck traces back to a TreeTools header (e.g. SplitList layout, bit-width of
`splitbit`), changes can be made in `../TreeTools`, tested locally by re-installing, and
pushed to CRAN when stable.

## Development Workflow

```r
# Build and reload (from R)
devtools::load_all()          # fast incremental rebuild
devtools::test()              # run testthat suite

# Or from the shell
R CMD build .
R CMD check TreeDist_*.tar.gz

# Run a single benchmark interactively
source("benchmark/_init.R")
source("benchmark/bench-tree-distances.R")
```

C++ compilation flags are controlled by `src/Makevars.win` (Windows) / `src/Makevars`.
The package requires **C++17** (`CXX_STD = CXX17`).

---

## Completed Optimizations (this dev cycle)

### OpenMP parallelism for pairwise distances (`src/pairwise_distances.cpp`)
Added `#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)` over the pairwise loop for
`MutualClusteringInfo` / `ClusteringInfoDistance`.  Build infrastructure:

- `src/Makevars` and `src/Makevars.win` created (these did not exist before);
  both set `CXX_STD = CXX17` and `PKG_CXXFLAGS/PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)`.
  On platforms without OpenMP the flags are empty and the package builds
  single-threaded.
- `lap()` in `lap.cpp` gained an `allow_interrupt = true` parameter; the batch
  path passes `false` to avoid calling `Rcpp::checkUserInterrupt()` from a
  worker thread.
- `add_ic_element` moved from `tree_distances.cpp` (inside `namespace TreeDist`,
  inaccessible to other TUs) into `tree_distances.h` as a proper `inline`,
  fixing a latent ODR issue and making it visible to `pairwise_distances.cpp`.
- `SplitList` is not move-constructible; `std::vector<SplitList>` therefore
  cannot be used (reserve/emplace_back require movability).  Fix: use
  `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<SplitList>>` instead.
- R fast path: `.SplitDistanceAllPairs()` in `tree_distance_utilities.R` detects
  `Func == MutualClusteringInfoSplits` with a same-tip-set, no-cluster call and
  routes it to `cpp_mutual_clustering_all_pairs()`.

**Benchmark script**: `benchmark/bench-MCI-openmp.R`
**To measure speedup**: install with `install.packages(".", repos=NULL, type="source")`
into a fresh library (avoids `devtools::load_all()` debug flags and Windows DLL lock).
Use `TreeDist:::cpp_mutual_clustering_all_pairs` when calling from an installed package.

#### Measured speedups (release build, -O2, 16-core Windows machine)

| Scenario | Serial R loop | R parallel (16 workers) | OpenMP batch |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 trees × 50 tips (4 950 pairs) | 117 ms | 78 ms | **17 ms** |
| 40 trees × 200 tips (780 pairs) | 292 ms | 3 350 ms | **35 ms** |

OpenMP vs serial: **7–8×**.  OpenMP vs R-parallel cluster: **5–95×** (R-parallel
incurs ~2–3 s serialisation overhead regardless of problem size).

#### R parallel cluster crossover (50-tip trees, 16 workers)

The R parallel cluster is only competitive with the serial loop when the problem
is large enough to amortise its ~2–3 s IPC/serialisation overhead.  For 50-tip
trees that crossover is around **500 trees (~125 000 pairs)**, where serial takes
~2.9 s and parallel takes ~2.8 s.  The OpenMP batch path remains faster than
both at every size measured.

Practical implication: **`StartParallel()` provides no benefit for MCI/CID** on
machines where OpenMP is available, and actively harms performance for typical
analysis sizes (≤ 200 trees).  The fast path therefore bypasses the R cluster
entirely when `cluster` is `NULL`.

#### OpenMP rollout to all remaining distance metrics (this dev cycle)

Extended OpenMP batch computation to all LAP-based and RF-info metrics.
Added score-only static functions and `cpp_*_all_pairs` exports in
`pairwise_distances.cpp` for:

| C++ batch function | R `Func` intercepted | LAP? |
|---|---|---|
| `cpp_rf_info_all_pairs` | `InfoRobinsonFouldsSplits` | No |
| `cpp_msd_all_pairs` | `MatchingSplitDistanceSplits` | Yes |
| `cpp_msi_all_pairs` | `MatchingSplitInfoSplits` | Yes |
| `cpp_shared_phylo_all_pairs` | `SharedPhylogeneticInfoSplits` | Yes |
| `cpp_jaccard_all_pairs` | `NyeSplitSimilarity`, `JaccardSplitSimilarity` | Yes |

The R fast-path in `.SplitDistanceAllPairs()` was refactored from a single
`if` block into a unified `if (!is.na(nTip) && is.null(cluster))` guard with
per-function branches, returning early only when a batch function matches.
For `JaccardSplitSimilarity`, `k` and `allowConflict` are extracted from `...`
with sensible defaults (1.0, TRUE) if absent.

## Known Optimization Opportunities / TODOs

- `information.h` line 19: comment suggests considering increasing `MAX_FACTORIAL_LOOKUP`
  beyond 8192 or falling back to runtime calculation for larger values.
- `information.h` lines 120–122: `log2_factorial_table` is a verbatim copy from
  `TreeSearch/src/expected_mi.cpp`; should be defined once (TreeTools?) and shared.
- LAP inner loop: the 4× manual unroll works well; investigate whether AVX2 SIMD
  intrinsics (`_mm256_*`) could replace it on modern hardware.
- `CostMatrix` transpose: currently maintained as a full second copy; a cache-oblivious
  blocking scheme (already partially implemented via `BLOCK_SIZE`) could reduce memory
  bandwidth further.
- SPR distance (`spr.cpp`, `spr_lookup.cpp`): the algorithm is relatively recent
  (v2.8.0); profiling under VTune may reveal further hot spots.
- OpenMP for other metrics: **DONE** — see "Completed Optimizations" below.
- Large-tree path (`int32` migration, v2.12.0 dev): ensure new code paths are as
  optimized as the original `int16` paths.
