- `SplitwiseInfo()` and `ClusteringInfo()` gain a `p` parameter to reflect the
  reduced information content of splits with lower support values, and a `sum`
  parameter to allow return of individual split information content.

- `Plot3()` (experimental) provides pseudo-3D plotting.


## Renamed functions

- `Project()`/`ProjectionQuality()` re-named to `MapTrees()`/`MappingQuality()`.
