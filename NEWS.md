# TreeDist 2.1.1.9000

- Further speed improvements, using optimizations suggested by 
  Alexis Stamatakis' Bioinformatics group.

# TreeDist 2.1.1

- Solaris compatibility.

- Modest vignette improvements.

- spic/scic abbreviation recognition.


# TreeDist 2.1.0

## New features

- `ConsensusInfo()` quickly calculates the splitwise information content of the
  consensus of a set of trees, after Smith (forthcoming).

- `SplitwiseInfo()` and `ClusteringInfo()` gain a `p` parameter to reflect the
  reduced information content of splits with lower support values, and a `sum`
  parameter to allow return of individual split information content.

- `KCDiameter()` approximates the diameter of the Kendall-Colijn metric.

- `Plot3()` (experimental) provides pseudo-3D plotting.


## Renamed functions

- `Project()`/`ProjectionQuality()` re-named to `MapTrees()`/`MappingQuality()`.

- `SpectralClustering()` re-named to `SpectralEigens()`.


## Improvements

- Add self-organizing map example to treespace vignette.

- Allow the specification of custom vectors in the Kendall--Colijn metric.

- Faster all-to-all tree distance calculation.


# TreeDist 2.0.3

- Diagnose and fix memory leaks, including over-long reported matchings.

- Explicitly import shiny/shinyjs functions.


# TreeDist 2.0.0

- `Project()` launches 'shiny' app for projection and analysis of tree space.

- `ProjectionQuality()` calculates trustworthiness and continuity of tree 
  space mappings.
  
- Faster calculation of Robinsonâ€“Foulds distance (using algorithm of Day (1985))
  and clustering information distance.
  
- New class `ClusterTable` to allow faster distance computation with Day (1985)
  algorithm.
  
- Improve error messages in `CalculateTreeDist()`.

- Improvements to vignettes.

- Use package 'vdiffr' conditionally.


# TreeDist 1.2.1

- Import RdMacros package 'RdPack'.


# TreeDist 1.2.0

- `TreeDistance()` and related functions now return a `dist` object when 
  computing all distances between all pairs of trees in a list.

- Improve floating-point arithmetic in `TreeDistance()` functions.

- `TreeDistance()` now returns a distance (as documented), rather than a
  similarity.

- Fix rounding error in NNI 'Li' upper estimate, and improve NNI performance.

- Reduce precision of LAPJV so rounding errors do not result in interminable run
  times.


# TreeDist 1.1.1

- Fix range errors when calculating tree distances.


# TreeDist 1.1.0

- Improvements to `NNIDist()` in light of Fack _et al._ (2002).

- Add `NNIDiameter()`: approximate diameter of NNI distance.
 
- Remove vignette 'Interpreting tree distances': duplicates
  https://ms609.github.io/TreeDistData/articles/09-expected-similarity.html.
  
- Remove redundant data object `oneOverlap`.

- Fix an issue when installing on R 3.x (require C++11 to ensure declaration 
  of `UINT_FAST16_MAX`).
  
- Fix memory-handling bug in `lapjv()`.


# TreeDist 1.0.0

- Initial release, building on some draft functions included in 
  '[TreeSearch](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/)' 0.3.2.9005.
